/**
 * Panic PIN PRACTICE — a genuinely safe rehearsal of the duress-entry flow.
 *
 * This page renders the exact same disguised keypad UI as the real entry
 * screen (`/safety/panic-pin/enter`) — same layout, same "no visible
 * difference between right and wrong" behavior — so practicing actually
 * builds the right muscle memory. The critical difference: this page NEVER
 * calls `safetyService.verifyPanicPin` and NEVER fires any SOS, no matter
 * what is typed here, including the user's real PIN. Every submission is
 * purely simulated client-side with a short artificial delay (so it still
 * *feels* like the real thing) and a random-ish "Verified." / "Incorrect
 * PIN." response, entirely disconnected from whatever the user's actual PIN
 * is.
 *
 * Why this had to be a separate route rather than a "practice mode" flag on
 * the real entry screen: the real screen's URL is meant to be bookmarked
 * under an unlabeled name and used *as* the duress trigger — anything that
 * could turn "practice mode" on or off via a query param or toggle on that
 * same URL would be discoverable by an attacker forcing the phone open, and
 * defeats the disguise. This route is reachable ONLY via an explicit
 * "Practice" entry point from the Panic PIN settings page (not by guessing
 * this URL — it's not linked from the disguised real-entry surface at all),
 * while the real disguised URL (`/safety/panic-pin/enter`) still looks
 * identical to a stranger and still does the real thing.
